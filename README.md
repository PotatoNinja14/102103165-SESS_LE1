Paper - Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition

Summary - The "Speech Commands" dataset was created to aid in training and evaluating keyword spotting systems. It contains short spoken word samples, collected in noisy environments, designed for resource-constrained devices. The paper also discusses the dataset's utility, methodology, and baseline model performance, enabling standard evaluations in speech recognition tasks.
